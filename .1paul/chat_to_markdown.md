## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- No additional dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Usage

### 1. Export Chat from VS Code

First, you need to export your chat history from VS Code:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Chat: Export Chat" and select it
3. Choose where to save your chat export JSON file
4. The file will contain your complete chat history in JSON format

### 2. Convert to Markdown

```bash
python3 chat_to_markdown.py chat.json chat.md
```

### 3. View Results

Open the generated Markdown file in any Markdown viewer or editor to see your formatted chat history.

## Sample Files

The `samples/` directory contains example files:

- **`chat.json`**: Original chat export from VS Code (404KB conversation about a repo organizer project)
- **`chat.md`**: Output from the conversion script with proper formatting, references, and navigation

## Output Format

The generated Markdown includes:

```markdown

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid JSON**: Ensure the exported chat file is valid JSON
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('chat.json'))"
   ```

2. **Python errors**: Run with error output for debugging
   ```bash
   python3 chat_to_markdown.py chat.json chat.md 2>&1
   ```

3. **Empty output**: Check if the input JSON has the expected VS Code chat structure
4. **File not found**: Verify file paths are correct and files exist
