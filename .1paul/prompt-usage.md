Based on the workspace, the following prompts can help you explain code in a project folder:

| Prompt | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [**Add Educational Comments**](prompts/add-educational-comments.prompt.md) | Adds educational comments to code files, explaining what code does and why, with configurable detail levels and knowledge levels for learning purposes. |
| [**Comment Code Generate A Tutorial**](prompts/comment-code-generate-a-tutorial.prompt.md) | Transforms Python scripts into beginner-friendly projects by refactoring code, adding instructional comments, and generating a complete markdown tutorial with setup instructions and example usage. |
| [**Repo Story Time**](prompts/repo-story-time.prompt.md) | Explores repository structure and explains the project's purpose, technologies, and key concepts by analyzing configuration files, documentation, and source directories. |
| [**Code Exemplars Blueprint Generator**](prompts/code-exemplars-blueprint-generator.prompt.md) | Analyzes a codebase to identify high-quality implementation examples and document best practices, patterns, and conventions used throughout the project. |
| [**Technology Stack Blueprint Generator**](prompts/technology-stack-blueprint-generator.prompt.md) | Generates comprehensive documentation of the technology stack, implementation patterns, and usage examples to help understand how a project is built. |
| [**Architecture Blueprint Generator**](prompts/architecture-blueprint-generator.prompt.md) | Creates detailed documentation of project architecture, component relationships, and design patterns to explain how the codebase is structured. |

The **Add Educational Comments** and **Comment Code Generate A Tutorial** prompts are most directly focused on explaining code, while the blueprint generators provide higher-level project understanding.
