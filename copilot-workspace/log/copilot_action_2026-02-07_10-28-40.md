- [x] Analyze application code (apps/)
- [x] Identify cross-cutting concerns

### Phase 3: Documentation Analysis
- [x] Review existing documentation
- [x] Identify documented patterns and conventions

### Phase 4: Blueprint Generation

## Summary

**Completed:** 2026-02-07 10:29:XX

### Deliverable
Generated comprehensive Project Architecture Blueprint saved to:
`.1paul/docs/Project_Architecture_Blueprint.md`

### Key Findings

**Project Type:** TypeScript/Node.js (ESM)

**Architecture Pattern:** Plugin-Based Modular Architecture with Gateway-Agent Pattern

**Core Components Documented:**
1. Gateway Server (`src/gateway/`) - Central WebSocket hub
2. Agent System (`src/agents/`) - AI agent execution
3. Channels System (`src/channels/`) - Multi-channel messaging
4. Plugin System (`src/plugins/`) - Extensibility framework
5. CLI Framework (`src/cli/`) - Command-line interface
6. Configuration System (`src/config/`) - YAML/Zod-validated config

**Extensions Analyzed:** 30+ channel and feature plugins

**Native Apps:** macOS, iOS, Android (Swift/Kotlin)

**Blueprint Sections:**
- Architectural overview and principles
- C4-style component diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Layer structure and dependencies
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, validation)
- Technology-specific patterns
- Testing architecture (Vitest, 70% coverage)
- Deployment modes (local, VPS, Docker, Fly.io)
- Extension patterns for new channels/providers
- Code examples demonstrating patterns
- Architectural Decision Records (4 ADRs)
- Development workflow guide
