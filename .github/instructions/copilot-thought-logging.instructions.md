# Copilot Process tracking Instructions

**ABSOLUTE MANDATORY RULES:**
- You must review these instructions in full before executing any steps to understand the full instructions guidelines.
- You must follow these instructions exactly as specified without deviation.
- Do not keep repeating status updates while processing or explanations unless explicitly required. This is bad and will flood Copilot session context.
- NO phase announcements (no "# Phase X" headers in output)
- Phases must be executed one at a time and in the exact order specified.
- NO combining of phases in one response
- NO skipping of phases
- NO verbose explanations or commentary
- Only output the exact text specified in phase instructions

# Phase 1: Initialization

- Generate a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS (use underscores and hyphens for filename compatibility)
- Create a NEW file `\copilot-workspace\log\copilot_action_<timestamp>.md` in workspace (e.g., `Copilot-Action-Log_2026-01-30_14-30-45.md`)
- If the `\copilot-workspace\log\` folder does not exist, create it first
- Each Copilot session MUST create a new log file with a unique timestamp - never reuse existing log files
- Populate the new log file with user request details
- Work silently without announcements until complete.
- When this phase is complete keep mental note of the exact filename created and that <Phase 1> is done and does not need to be repeated.

# Phase 2: Planning

- Generate an action plan into the timestamped log file created in Phase 1.
- Generate detailed and granular task specific action items to be used for tracking each action plan item with todo/complete status in the same log file.
- This should include:
  - date and time stamp of when plan was created
  - Specific tasks for each action item in the action plan as a phase.
  - Clear descriptions of what needs to be done
  - Any dependencies or prerequisites for each task
  - Ensure tasks are granular enough to be executed one at a time
- Work silently without announcements until complete.
- When this phase is complete keep mental note of this that <Phase 2> is done and does not need to be repeated.

# Phase 3: Execution

- Execute action items from the action plan in logical groupings/phases
- Work silently without announcements until complete.
- Update the timestamped log file created in Phase 1 and mark the action item(s) as complete in the tracking.
- When a phase is complete keep mental note of this that the specific phase from the log file is done and does not need to be repeated.
- Repeat this pattern until all action items are complete

# Phase 4: Summary

- Add summary to the timestamped log file created in Phase 1
- Work silently without announcements until complete.
- Execute only when ALL actions complete
- Inform user: "Added final summary to `\copilot-workspace\log\copilot_action_<timestamp>.md`." (use the actual filename created)
- Remind user to review the summary and confirm completion of the process.


**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- NEVER write "# Phase X" headers in responses
- NEVER repeat the word "Phase" in output unless explicitly required
- NEVER provide explanations beyond the exact text specified
- NEVER combine multiple phases in one response
- NEVER continue past current phase without user input
- Always time stamp action plan creation in Phase 2. The format should be: "Action Plan created on: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
- If you catch yourself being verbose, STOP and provide only required output
- If you catch yourself about to skip a phase, STOP and go back to the correct phase
- If you catch yourself combining phases, STOP and perform only the current phase
